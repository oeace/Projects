<h4>Patricia Kuusisto, LCSW Life-Cycle Educator
Individual, Family & Group Therapy There is no question; life is a process that challenges us, <br>
especially as we age. We all will face illness, trauma, change, conflicts,and, inevitably, death. Regardless of the issue, feelings of despair,fear,<br>
grief, anxiety, and depression arise in us all. We do find ways to get through the crisis. We may even come to recognize rat <br>
the darkest moments can turn out to be our greatest teachers. They show us the depth of our resilience, courage, and wisdom. However,<br>
coping alone can be difficult at these critical and transitional times. We can benefit greatly knowing we are not alone. <br>
Even though it may be unfamiliar, asking for help is vital.For more than 30 years, I have worked to create a unique, holistic process <br>
to help people successfully negotiate the waters of their life cycles. We integrate traditional counseling, life-cycle education, <br>
body-oreinted modalities, creative arts, and spiritual practices. Using this approach allows us to discover and share our vulnerabilities.<br>
We come to realize we are not along and "what belongs to one belongs to all. Although we may not have it all together, together we have it all."<br>

Sheri is a business professional who brings an unparalleled depth of experience and sophisticated understanding, the ability to deal with complex details quickly<br>
and effectively, and a sensitivity to her clients' needs and confidences."What I've always found most satisfying about my legal cases is taking a morass of facts<br>
and carefully unraveling them into a coherent narrative for my clients. That mastery of the facts was the key to the success of all my cases, and has been essential<br>
 to my work as an Executor.In one estate, for example, I identified over $100,000 in assets that the family didn't know existed. That amount more than offset the estate.”<br>

years led to the founding of Holistic TurtlesHealthy Aging, and informs my practice every day. I am a certified Kripalu Yoga Teacher (RYT) and Movement Specialist, and trained at the <br>
prestigious Laban Centre for Movement and Dance in London. I have worked all over Westchester County teaching and consulting at Community Centers, Schools, Group Homes, Senior Centers, <br>
and Labor Union facilities. My multidisciplinary experience in the fields of movement exploration, which includes forays into Contact improvisation, the Feldenkrais Movement, and social <br>
dancing, has led me to create a new program involving breathwork, mindfulness, and movement. I help adults, primarily 55+, to release tension, stress, and anxiety through body and mind <br>
exercises. Most of my clients have never practised Yoga before and come to class with curiosity and a beginner's mind. I inspire them by teaching them skills that they can use in other <br>
aspects of their daily living.<br>

<h4>Debra Lang, Owner of Seniors Helping Seniors of Westchester and Putnam Counties<br>
Several years ago, while I was helping a 92 year-old member of my church community pack up his apartment after his wife passed away, I was truly inspired by his stories...as together<br>
we looked at the photographic evidence of a full and well-lived life, I gained keen insight into the challenges and changes that come as we transition through life's stages. It was <br>
also at that time that it became clear how important it is for seniors to have strong support...and who better to provide that support than another senior who understands the aging<br>
process firsthand! In February of 2013, Debra opened her Seniors Helping Seniors franchise, a unique non-medical home care agency, serving Westchester and Putnam Counties, which pairs <br>
active, skilled, local senior caregivers with senior clients who need practical, cost-effective help with day-to-day things or companionship to help cope with feeling isolated or lonely.<br>
Our senior caregivers provide respectful, compassionate, one-to-one support to help seniors enjoy life to the fullest while remaining independent in their own homes.<br>
